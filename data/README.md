# Data

### Quickstart:

* If you haven't already, make sure you are at the `/data` directory with the following command:
```
cd data
```

* Run the code to create the CSV containing our data:
```
python create_csv.py --set_persons 8 --set_persons 10000
```

* If you are starting at the `./data` directory, you should find the CSV in `./CSVs/data.csv`.
